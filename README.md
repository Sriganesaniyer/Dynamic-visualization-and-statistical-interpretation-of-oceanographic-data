•	To develop a lightweight, responsive dashboard that can visualize oceanographic parameters dynamically.
•	To integrate rolling statistical analyses (e.g., moving averages, z-scores) for interpreting short-term trends.
•	To include automated alert generation for critical ocean conditions, such as high wave activity or low dissolved oxygen levels.
•	To support modular visualization of parameters across five key categories: Ocean Conditions, Wave Analysis, Water Quality, Disaster Monitoring, and Statistical Analysis.
